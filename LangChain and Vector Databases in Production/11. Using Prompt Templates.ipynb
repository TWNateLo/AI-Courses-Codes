    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the era of language models, the ability to perform a wide range of tasks is at our fingertips. These models operate on a straightforward principle: they accept a text input sequence and generate an output text sequence. The key factor in this process is the input text or prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Crafting suitable prompts is vital for anyone working with large language models, as poorly constructed prompts yield unsatisfactory outputs, while well-formulated prompts lead to powerful results. Recognizing the importance of prompts, the LangChain library has developed a comprehensive suite of objects tailored for them.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson delves into the nuances of PromptTemplates and how to employ them effectively. A PromptTemplate is a predefined structure or pattern used to construct effective and consistent prompts for large language models. It is a guideline to ensure the input text or prompt is properly formatted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of using a PromptTemplate with a single dynamic input for a user query. Remember to define the OPENAI_API_KEY in your environment variables with your OPEN AI key. Remember also to install the required packages with the following command: pip install langchain==0.0.208 openai==0.27.8 tiktoken."

    "- Improved context understanding: By providing examples, the AI can grasp the context and style of responses more effectively, enabling it to generate responses that are more in line with the desired output.\n",
    "- Flexibility: Dynamic prompts can be easily customized and adapted to specific use cases, allowing developers to experiment with different prompt structures and find the most effective format for their application.\n",
