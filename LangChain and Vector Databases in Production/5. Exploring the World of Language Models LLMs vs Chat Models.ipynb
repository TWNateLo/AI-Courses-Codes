    "Large Language Models have made significant advancements in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), enabling AI systems to understand and generate human-like text. ChatGPT is a popular language model based on Transformers architecture, enabling it to understand long texts and figure out how words or ideas are connected. It's great at making predictions about language and relationships between words.\n",

    "LLMs, such as GPT-3, Bloom, PaLM, and Aurora genAI, take a text string as input and return a text string as output. They are trained on language modeling tasks and can generate human-like text, perform complex reasoning, and even write code. LLMs are powerful and flexible, capable of generating text for a wide range of tasks. However, they can sometimes produce incorrect or nonsensical answers, and their API is less structured compared to Chat Models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pre-training these models involves presenting large-scale corpora to them and allowing the network to predict the next word, which results in learning the relationships between words. This learning process enables LLMs to generate high-quality text, which can be applied to an array of applications, such as automatic form-filling and predictive text on smartphones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of these models are trained on general purpose training dataset, while others are trained on a mix of general and domain-specific data, such as Intel Aurora genAI, which is trained on general text, scientific texts, scientific data, and codes related to the domain. The goal of domain specific LLMs is to increase the performance on a particularly domain, while still being able to solve the majority of tasks that general LLM can manage.\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs have the potential to infiltrate various aspects of human life, including the arts, sciences, and law. With continued development, LLMs will become increasingly integrated into our educational, personal, and professional lives, making them an essential technology to master.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can follow these steps to use a large language model (LLM) like GPT-3 in LangChain. Import the OpenAICopy wrapper from the langchain.llmsCopy module and Initialize it with the desired model name and any additional arguments. For example, set a high temperature for more random outputs. Then, create a PromptTemplateCopy to format the input for the model. Lastly, define an LLMChainCopy to combine the model and prompt. Run the chain with the desired input using .run()Copy. As mentioned before, remember to set your OpenAI key saved in the ‚ÄúOPENAI_API_KEY‚Äù environment variable before running the following codes. Remember to install the required packages with the following command: pip install langchain==0.1.4 deeplake openai==1.10.0 tiktokenCopy."

    "**HumanMessage:** These messages come from the user and represent their input to the AI model. The AI model is expected to respond to these messages. In LangChain, you can customize the human prefix (e.g., \"User\") in the conversation summary to change how the human input is represented.\n",
    "\n",
    "**AIMessage:** These messages are sent from the AI's perspective as it interacts with the human user. They represent the AI's responses to human input. Like HumanMessage, you can also customize the AI prefix (e.g., \"AI Assistant\" or \"AI\") in the conversation summary to change how the AI's responses are represented.\n",

This particular use case goes beyond what we covered in the previous lesson. We'll be employing multiple message types to differentiate between users' queries and system instructions instead of relying on a single prompt. This approach will enhance the model's comprehension of the given requirements.\n",
