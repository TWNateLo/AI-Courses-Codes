It starts by setting the context for the model (SystemMessage) that it is an assistant, followed by the user’s query (HumanMessage), and finishes by defining a sample response from the AI model (AIMessage). Remember to install the required packages with the following command: pip install langchain==0.1.4 deeplake openai==1.10.0 tiktoken."
